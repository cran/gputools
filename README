gputools under Unix/Linux
=========================

The CUDA toolkit and a CUDA capable driver must be installed to use
this package.  The package is installed by the command 'R CMD
INSTALL gputools'.  If you are installing from source, make sure that
the environment variable 'CUDA_HOME' is set to the root of the 
CUDA toolkit installation directory (e.g. 'export CUDA_HOME=/usr/local/cuda')
or use the option 
"--configure-args='--with-cuda-home=<your cuda toolkit dir>'"
with 'R CMD INSTALL'.
