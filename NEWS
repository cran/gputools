gputools changes
=================

changes in gputools 0.01.3

- Mac os x and nvidia cards with compute capability less than 1.3 are now
supported. Systems lacking a gpu altogether also recieve some support. See the
file INSTALL for details.

- gpuHclust, gpuDist, and gpuQr now output the same classes as R's base hclust,
dist, and qr functions.

- The c code now uses r's api. Host memory allocation and error reporting
have recieved a facelift.

- gpuGranger now reports the correct p-values and is slightly faster for small
data sets.

- Some bugs with gpuCor's pearson method have been fixed.
