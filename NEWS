gputools changes
=================

changes in gputools 0.26
- fixes to several potential bugs:  
	There was a variable in the QR code which was never  
	deallocated.  Also, there were several variables freed with  
	the wrong method. Also, added a missing cublasInit/Shutdown pair.
	Thanks to Eunjin Lee's error reporting!

changes in gputools 0.24

- added support for configure argument --with-compiler-bindir and
	environment variable COMPILER_BINDIR to support gcc located somewhere
	other than the user's path. Use one of these to get the package
	installed in flavors of Linux that ship with default gcc version > 4.4.

- A couple of changes to the Makefile:
	* added -I. for compatibility with R 2.12
	* switched from CC to NVCC for compat with ~/.R/Makevars

notes section)

- fixed a bug in gpuMi

- added a demo of CULA use: fastICA with CULA's svd plugged in.

changes in gputools 0.1.3

- Mac os x and nvidia cards with compute capability less than 1.3 are now
supported. Systems lacking a gpu altogether also recieve some support. See the
file INSTALL for details.

- gpuHclust, gpuDist, and gpuQr now output the same classes as R's base hclust,
dist, and qr functions.

- The c code now uses r's api. Host memory allocation and error reporting
have recieved a facelift.

- gpuGranger now reports the correct p-values and is slightly faster for small
data sets.

- Some bugs with gpuCor's pearson method have been fixed.
