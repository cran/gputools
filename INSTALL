gputools

=========

To install the package, you must first install Nvidia's CUDA Toolkit available from

http://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads

You will need an Nvidia GPU of compute capability >= 2.

=========

Installation

If the package installation fails with an error:

Set the environment variable CUDA_HOME to the root of your CUDA toolkit installation.

If that doesn't help, there are several 'configure options' that may be set from the command line:

R CMD INSTALL --configure-args="<gputools configure options>" gputools_0.5.tar.gz

<gputools configure options> include:
--with-nvcc=<path to nvcc>
--with-cuda=<path to CUDA toolkit root>
--with-r=<path to root of R install>
--with-r-include=<path to R header files>
--with-r-lib=<path to libR.so or libR.dylib>

For example:
R CMD INSTALL --configure-args="--with-nvcc=/usr/local/cuda/bin/nvcc --with-r-lib=/usr/local/share/R/lib64" gputools_0.5.tar.gz

Enjoy!
